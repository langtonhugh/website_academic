I am a researcher in quantitative criminology at the [Crime and Well-being Big Data Centre](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/crime-and-wellbeing-big-data-centre/), a research institute based at [Manchester Metropolitan University](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/).

My research focuses on describing and explaining the geographic patterning of crime, particularly the relationship between crime hotspots and where known offenders live. I am also interested in data visualisation, mapping and promoting the use of open software in social science.
