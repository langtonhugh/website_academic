I am a Research Fellow in Crime Science on the [COVID-19 and crime project](https://covid19-crime.com/) at the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/).

My research focuses on describing and explaining the geographic patterning of crime. I am also interested in data visualisation, mapping and promoting the use of open software in social science.

This website provides an overview of my ongoing work, but for a complete summary please check my [CV](https://www.samlangton.info/files/Langton_CV_2020.pdf).
