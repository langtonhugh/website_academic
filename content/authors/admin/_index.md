I am currently working to promote and develop [open science practices](https://www.nwo.nl/en/open-science), [FAIR data](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), [reproducibility](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547546/) and [software sustainability](https://www.software.ac.uk/) at the [Amsterdam UMC](https://www.amsterdamumc.org/en/organization/amsterdam-umc.htm).

This website provides an overview of my ongoing work. If you'd like to speak about any of the above, or collaborate on an open data project, please [get in touch](https://www.samlangton.info/#contact)!
