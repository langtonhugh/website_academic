I am a [former postdoc researcher](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GKweRb8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and current open science enthusiast. I've recently finished [a project](https://zenodo.org/records/15095022) on promoting and developing open science practices and computational reproducibility at [Amsterdam University Medical Center](https://www.amsterdamumc.org/en/organization/amsterdam-umc.htm).
