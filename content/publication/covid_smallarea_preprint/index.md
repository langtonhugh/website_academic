abstract: It is well established that COVID-19 policies to restrict movement induced widespread falls in many crime types internationally. Much less is known about variation between areas in how these changes occurred. This study uses k-means clustering to examine local area variation in police notifiable offences across England and Wales. It finds that crime in most areas remained stable, a small proportion of areas accounting for disproportionate change. These were typically city centers with plentiful pre-pandemic crime opportunities, dominated by theft and shoplifting offences. We explore potential implications for policy, theory and further research.
