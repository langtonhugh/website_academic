abstract: The 'akmedoids' package advances a set of R functions for longitudinal clustering of long-term trajectories and determines the optimal solution based on the Calinski-Harabatz criterion. The package also includes a set of functions for addressing common data issues, such as missing entries and outliers, prior to conducting analysis.
