I have designed and taught a number of courses using R and RStudio, including the development of teaching material both on my own and with colleagues.

## Amsterdam University Medical Center

I founded the first organisation-wide R user group. You can read more about our activities on the dedicated [website](https://langtonhugh.github.io/rum_umc/). I also designed and taught a pilot workshop on GitHub Desktop. The material is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/langtonhugh/github_desktop). I gave a number of presentations about how to improve reproducibility in R, which are also [openly available](https://github.com/langtonhugh/reprod_r). 

## NSCR

Co-organise an (ongoing) series of R training workshops at the [NSCR](https://nscr.nl/). This includes leading a two-day Data Carpenties workshop, the material for which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/langtonhugh/nscr_carpentries). I am also co-chairing a reading group for [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/) for which there is a corresponding [open repository](https://github.com/langtonhugh/regression_book_nscr). You can read more about our activities on [our website](https://nscrweb.netlify.app/).

## Royal Statistical Society conference

Led an introductory session to the `tidyverse` at the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) 2021 conference, along with colleagues from the University of Manchester. Material is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/langtonhugh/rss_r).

## Data visualisation in R using crime data

1-day workshop on data visualisation and mapping at the [Cathie Marsh Institute](https://www.cmi.manchester.ac.uk/) (University of Manchester) in collaboration with the [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/). Material can be found on the [UK Data Service website](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/news-and-events/eventsitem/?id=5552).

The course was subsequently updated and re-ran online with the [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/) and [Methods@Manchester](https://www.methods.manchester.ac.uk/). All material is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/langtonhugh/data_viz_R_workshop).


## R for police forces

1-day workshop on data wrangling and visualisation for West Midlands Police Force. Please get in contact for material.

## R for criminologists

1-day workshop on data wrangling, visualisation and mapping hosted at the [European Society of Criminology](https://www.esc-eurocrim.org/) with colleagues from the [Space Place and Crime working group](http://www.space-place-crime.eu/). Material is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/langtonhugh/ESC2019) and [rpubs](https://rpubs.com/spaceplacecrime).

## Getting Started in R - an introduction to data analysis and visualisation

4-day comprehensive introductory course at the [Methods@Manchester](https://www.methods.manchester.ac.uk/) summer school, co-taught with colleagues. Material is available as a [website](https://rcatlord.github.io/GSinR/).

## Cluster analysis in R

1-day workshop introducing cluster analysis in R at the [Cathie Marsh Institute](https://www.cmi.manchester.ac.uk/) (University of Manchester), co-taught with a colleague. Please get in contact for material.

## R for social scientists

I am a qualified instructor for [Data and Software Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), and supported colleagues in teaching the [social science workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/).

## A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Statistics for Criminology and Criminal Justice Using R

Co-authored a textbook introducing R for criminology students, published by Springer. Available from [Springer's website](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-50625-4).
