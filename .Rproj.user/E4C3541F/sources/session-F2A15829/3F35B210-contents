I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement](https://nscr.nl/). I am also a Visiting Research Fellow for the [Policy Evaluation and Research Unit](https://www.mmuperu.co.uk/) at [Manchester Metropolitan University](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/).

My research focuses on the spatial and temporal patterning of crime. I am also interested in promoting the use of open software -- mainly R -- through my [teaching](https://www.samlangton.info/project/r-teaching/) and [openly available code](https://github.com/langtonhugh). If you want to collaborate on an open data project, please get in touch!

This website provides an overview of my ongoing work, but for a complete summary please check my [CV](https://www.samlangton.info/files/sam_langton_cv.pdf).
